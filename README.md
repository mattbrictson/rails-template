# mattbrictson/rails-template

[![Build Status](https://mattbrictson.semaphoreci.com/badges/rails-template/branches/main.svg?style=shields)](https://mattbrictson.semaphoreci.com/projects/rails-template)

## Description

This is the application template that I recommend for Rails 7 projects. I've assembled this template over the years to include best-practices, tweaks, documentation, and personal preferences, while still generally adhering to the "Rails way".

For older versions of Rails, use these branches:

* [Rails 6.1.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-61)
* [Rails 6.0.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-60)
* [Rails 5.2.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-52)
* [Rails 5.1.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-51)
* [Rails 5.0.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-50)
* [Rails 4.2.x](https://github.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/tree/rails-42)

## Requirements

This template currently works with:

* Rails 7.0.x
* Bundler 2.x
* PostgreSQL

*When using `--javascript vite`:*
* Node 16 or later
* Yarn 1.x

If you need help setting up a Ruby development environment, check out my [Rails OS X Setup Guide](https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide).

## Installation

*Optional.*

To make this the default Rails application template on your system, create a `~/.railsrc` file with these contents:

```
-d postgresql
-m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/main/template.rb
```

## Usage

This template assumes you will store your project in a remote git repository (e.g. GitHub) and that you will deploy to a production environment. It will prompt you for this information in order to pre-configure your app, so be ready to provide:

1. The git URL of your (freshly created and empty) GitHub repository
2. The hostname of your production server

To generate a Rails application using this template, pass the `-m` option to `rails new`, like this:

```
rails new blog \
  -d postgresql \
  -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattbrictson/rails-template/main/template.rb
```

*Remember that options must go after the name of the application.* The only database supported by this template is `postgresql`.

If you’ve installed this template as your default (using `~/.railsrc` as described above), then all you have to do is run:

```
rails new blog
```

## What does it do?

The template will perform the following steps:

1. Generate your application files and directories
2. Create the development and test databases
3. Commit everything to git
4. Push the project to the remote git repository you specified

## What is included?

#### Optional support for `vite_rails`⚡️

Add the `--javascript vite` option to the `rails new` command to get started with Vite! [Vite][vite] is an easy to use alternative to Webpack(er), and much more powerful than the standard import map and css/jsbundling-rails options that are built into Rails.

- Frontend code (JS, CSS, images) will be placed in `app/frontend/`
- Run `yarn start` to start the development server with hot reloading
- SCSS will be used for styles (the `--css` option will be ignored)

If you don't specify `--javascript vite`, then this template will use the standard Rails 7 behavior.

#### These gems are added to the standard Rails stack

* Core
    * [active_type][] – for building simple and effective form/service objects
    * [sidekiq][] – Redis-based job queue implementation for Active Job
* Configuration
    * [dotenv][] – for local configuration
* Style
    * [Pico.css][pico] - a great-looking default stylesheet
* Utilities
    * [annotate][] – auto-generates schema documentation
    * [good_migrations][] - prevents app models from being improperly referenced in migrations
    * [rubocop][] – enforces Ruby code style
    * [erblint][] – applies rubocop rules within html.erb files
* Security
    * [brakeman][] and [bundler-audit][] – detect security vulnerabilities
* Testing
    * [capybara-lockstep][] – for more reliable browser testing
    * [factory_bot_rails][] – for easy setup of test data
    * [shoulda][] – shortcuts for common ActiveRecord tests

#### Postmark

I like to use [Postmark][] for transactional email, and so I've included the [postmark-rails][] gem and configured it in `environments/production.rb`. Make sure to sign up for a Postmark account to get an API key, or switch to your own preferred email provider before deploying your app.

#### Other tweaks that patch over some Rails shortcomings

* A much-improved `bin/setup` script
* Log rotation so that development and test Rails logs don’t grow out of control

## How does it work?

This project works by hooking into the standard Rails [application templates][] system, with some caveats. The entry point is the [template.rb][] file in the root of this repository.

Normally, Rails only allows a single file to be specified as an application template (i.e. using the `-m <URL>` option). To work around this limitation, the first step this template performs is a `git clone` of the `mattbrictson/rails-template` repository to a local temporary directory.

This temporary directory is then added to the `source_paths` of the Rails generator system, allowing all of its ERb templates and files to be referenced when the application template script is evaluated.

Rails generators are very lightly documented; what you’ll find is that most of the heavy lifting is done by [Thor][]. The most common methods used by this template are Thor’s `copy_file`, `template`, and `gsub_file`. You can dig into the well-organized and well-documented [Thor source code][thor] to learn more.
