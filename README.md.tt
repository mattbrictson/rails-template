# <%= app_name %>

This is a Rails <%= Rails::VERSION::MAJOR %> app.

## Documentation

This README describes the purpose of this repository and how to set up a development environment.

## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* Ruby <%= RUBY_VERSION %>, preferably managed using [rbenv][]
* PostgreSQL must be installed and accepting connections
* [Redis][] must be installed and running on localhost with the default port

On a Mac, you can obtain all of the above packages using [Homebrew][].

If you need help setting up a Ruby development environment, check out this [Rails OS X Setup Guide](https://mattbrictson.com/rails-osx-setup-guide).

## Getting started

### bin/setup

Run the `bin/setup` script. This script will:

* Check you have the required Ruby version
* Install dependencies using Bundler and Yarn
* Create a `.env.development` file
* Create, migrate, and seed the database

### Run it!

1. Run `bin/rake` to run all tests and lint checks.
2. Start the app with `yarn start`
